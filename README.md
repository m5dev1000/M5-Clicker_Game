This is just a simple clicker game. 
If you want to edit it use the "CLICKERGAME.ino".
The files for flashing the game are in /build, or in the release.
In order to use other M5 devices please read https://docs.m5stack.com/en/arduino/arduino_ide and edit the "M5StickCPlus2" in "#include <M5StickCPlus2.h>" to your device based on its name in Arduino IDE. Edit the location of the buttons if the buttons are messed up in your device.
